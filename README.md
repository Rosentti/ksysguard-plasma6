# What is KSysGuard?
KSysGuard is a program to monitor various elements of your system, or any
other remote system with the KSysGuard daemon (ksysgardd) installed. 
Currently the daemon has been ported to Linux, FreeBSD, Irix, NetBSD,
OpenBSD, Solaris and Tru64 with varying degrees of completion.

# This is not an extended support repo
This is only for a basic port to Qt6 and Plasma 6 (Beta 1).
I don't intend to add features or reimplement old features broken by the Qt6 port. 


# TODO
- Rendering is quite broken with Qt6
- Some features needed to be removed:
  - Log file related stuff
