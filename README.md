# What is KSysGuard?
KSysGuard is a program to monitor various elements of your system, or any
other remote system with the KSysGuard daemon (ksysguardd) installed. 

# This is not an extended support repo
This is only for a basic port to Qt6 and Plasma 6 (Beta 1).
I don't intend to add features or reimplement old features broken by the Qt6 port. 

# TODO
- Rendering is quite broken with Qt6
- Some features needed to be removed:
  - Log file related stuff (I can accept PRs for this, but will not reimplement it myself)
